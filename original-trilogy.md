## 0. The Fool

**Max,** with his dog, overlooking the camp from a cliff above.

## I. The Magician

**The Gyro Captain.** The Gyro Captain, like his *Beyond Thunderdome* reincarnation Jedediah, provides the impetus to the quest that ultimately brings Max to meet all the subsequent characters: as such, he fits well as the card in the first position.

Also, the Magician is traditionally depicted as having a sideways figure-eight above his head - for the Gyro Captain, this could be the propeller of the gyro behind him.

(Yes, the Gyro Captain is more of a comic-relief character than Max, so you might think he'd be The Fool, but that's an overly-narrow interpretation of the cards. It's not about *demeanor*, it's about *role* - and, not to spoil the ending narration of The Road Warrior, but the Gyro Captain ends up being no fool.)

## II. The High Priestess

Savannah Nix would make sense here, but I feel she fits better on The Star.

Could go with The Captain's Girl, though I feel like that's kind of a waste of a face card.

## III. The Empress

**Auntie Entity.** She's either the High Priestess or The Empress, and Empress befits her position better, not to mention it sets her up to play opposite Master's Emperor.

## IV. The Emperor

**Master Blaster** (or just a close-up on Master, if Blaster ends up working better as The Tower).

## V. The Hierophant

**Dr. Dealgood.**

## VI. The Lovers

**Wez and the Golden Youth.** The Golden Youth is basically an escapee from a Pamela Colman-Smith illustration in the first place, and it's his relation to Wez that defines basically his entire motivation.

## VII. The Chariot

**Max's Pursuit Special,** the Last of the V8 Interceptors. For a series so fixated on cars, it'd be a waste to pick anything else.

## VIII. Strength

Pig Killer tending to a pig?

### Rejected

- Lord Humungus comforting Wez: as perfect as that scene fits, Humungus and Wez already have cards, and this moment isn't iconic for Wez.

## IX. The Hermit

**May Swaisey,** because she was living far from the rest of civilization *before* it was... well, not "cool", but "functionally necessary for basic survival".

## X. Wheel of Fortune

**Bartertown *literally has* a Wheel of Fortune** ("break a deal, spin the wheel"). Picking anything else would be a *massive* oversight.

## XI. Justice

Thunderdome. Yes, "Justice" usually depicts a figure, but Bartertown knows only one kind of justice, and that is the kind where *TWO MEN ENTER - ONE MAN LEAVES*.

## XII. The Hanged Man

Johnny the Boy. He fits the bill of a pariah left for dead by his cohort, who is nonetheless smug about his situation.

## XIII. Death

**Toecutter.** Toecutter is responsible for the deaths that "ended" Max Rockatansky and heralded the dawning of *Mad Max*.

## XIV. Temperance

Uh... whoever put together the explosives before the big battle at the climax of The Road Warrior. (Was that The Captain's Girl? If so, that'd certainly bring High Priestess into clearer contrast.)

## XV. The Devil

**Lord Humungus.** I considered Humungus for The Emperor, but the Master Blaster / Auntie Entity interplay was too enticing to resist - and, with Humungus as Emperor, there'd be a massive void to fill for the role of The Devil.

## XVI. The Tower

**Scrooloose,** in conjunction with the kid who thinks he's a flight control tower. Works especially well when noted in terms of The Tower's relation to Death.

Sincerely considered Blaster as "The Tower", getting "struck" by crossbow bolts to the chest, but I like this idea better. (Worst case scenario: just Auntie Entity's tower.)

## XVII. The Star

**Savannah Nix,** collecting water for a journey into the wastes.

## XVIII. The Moon

**Slake M'Thirst**, because Savannah Nix is the preceding card, and they did that rescue mission by night.

## XIX. The Sun

The **Feral Kid**, riding a bus like a horse ahead of the sunrise.

## XX. Judgement

pocky clips

## XXI. The World

Max's family! Losing them is when the world *truly* ended, for him.
