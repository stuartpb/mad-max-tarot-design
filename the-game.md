## 0. The Fool

**Max**, obviously.

If you're doing a Tarot deck themed around a Hero's Journey, your hero is The Fool. Even if your hero is literally The Devil, you put him on The Fool (in that case, you'll probably want to get clever and put whoever The Devil's antagonist is on the Devil card). All heroes are fools - if they were anybody else, we wouldn't care to follow them. (And, if you look at *Fury Road*, "Fool" is the *exact nickname* Furiosa gives Max.)

## I. The Magician

**Chumbucket.** Chumbucket has magical abilities with engines (with the right tools, he can repair a car on the verge of exploding to full health in seven seconds), and it's his intervention that kicks off Max's story - Chum represents the adventure's inception better than anything.

I recognize that Chumbucket is *literally* a hermit, but thematically, there's *another* Hermit in this story that fits the bill much better.

## II. The High Priestess

**Tenderloin,** I guess? (Get it? "High" Priestess? Egh.)

## III. The Empress

**Pink Eye.**

## IV. The Emperor

**Gutgash.** Yes, Lord Scrotus is more of an Emperor than Gutgash, but that'd leave the deck without a figurehead for Death and/or The Devil - and The Emperor should really be someone who fits opposite The Empress, and there's nobody in the game who'd fit *that* bill better than Pink Eye.

## V. The Hierophant

**Deep Friah.** Pretty natural fit, for someone who goes on and on about the Holy Flame so much.

## VI. The Lovers

**The Outcrier and 'Lectricity Boy,** only because I'm pretty sure these are the only two characters in the game with *any* sort of relationship.

## VII. The Chariot

**Chum's Buggy.** Since there's no one canonical design for the Magnum Opus

## VIII. Strength

**Blas Cap**? Blas Cap's a blackfinger, right, like Chumbucket? And Strength has the infinity sign above their head, like the Magician?

## IX. The Hermit

**Griffa.**

## X. Wheel of Fortune

**Crow Dazzle** and a Death Race?

## XI. Justice

**Abdominous,** because he helps Max find justice?

## XII. The Hanged Man

**Scab,** getting hanged as a blood bag, right next to Abdominous?

(Yes, there's somebody who literally gets hanged near the end of the story, but that's not the *crux* of the character. Also, spoilers.)

## XIII. Death

**Scrotus Scabrous.**

## XIV. Temperance

**Jeet,** piercing his face because of his temper *yet again*.

## XV. The Devil

**Stank Gum.** Much like Death and The Devil, you can go back and forth about whether or not Stank Gum is "worse" than Scrotus. However, between the two, I'd say Stank Gum is the leader with the more shackles-and-chains approach, while Scrotus is more of a "force of nature".

## XVI. The Tower

**Pink Eye's Silo.** This was kind of a toss-up between Pink Eye and Jeet's Stronghold, since they're both towers - I'm leaning toward Pink Eye's, largely because it's under siege when you first get there, and that matches the characterization of The Tower.

## XVII. The Star

One of the Wasteland Wanderers, filling a canteen at a water gatherer.

## XVIII. The Moon

**Blowing up The Jaw in Dead Barrens Pass.**

## XIX. The Sun

The sun, bleaching the bones of a child and a horse in the Wasteland.

## XX. Judgement

An Oil Pump / Transfer Tank Camp getting blown up.

## XXI. The World

**Hope.**
